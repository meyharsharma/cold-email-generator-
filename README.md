# Cold Email Generator for Job Applications  

## Project Overview  
This project is a **Cold Email Generator** designed to help job seekers craft personalized cold emails when applying for jobs. As a **Data Science graduate student**, this project helps me apply my NLP skills by fine-tuning and deploying an LLM for text generation
while also building a practical application that streamlines my job search. By automating the email writing process, this tool helps me save time and improve outreach efficiency, making my job hunt more effective. The project leverages **Llama 3.3**, a powerful open source LLM, for generating context aware email content, and **ChromaDB**, a vector database, for efficient retrieval of past emails and personalization data.  

## Features  
- **AI-Powered Email Generation**: Uses Llama 3.3 to generate customized cold emails based on job descriptions and user input.  
- **Vector Search with ChromaDB**: Stores and retrieves past emails to maintain consistency and personalization.  
- **Dynamic Personalization**: Adjusts tone, structure, and content based on the recipient’s profile and company details.   

## Tech Stack  
- **Llama 3.3** – for natural language generation  
- **ChromaDB** – for storing and retrieving past emails efficiently  
- **Python** – main programming language  
- **Streamlit** – for UI
